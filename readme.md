# Alighieri

This is supposed to be guided through heaven by a certain Beatrice.

"Dante claims to have met a 'Beatrice' only twice, on occasions separated by nine years, but was so affected by the meetings that he carried his love for her throughout his life."

Lol Dante.

### Findings

* rising_bagel_count positively correlated with matches / mmr
* photo_score with face detection. Presumably those with one and only one face score highest
* sending the same request as yesterday gets you back today's matches `api.coffeemeetsbagel.com/bagels?embed=profile&prefetch=true` 
* pics can be accessed without a token on cloudfront (presumably only for caching?). Url pattern would probably be hard to infer.
* birthdays are almost certainly always wrong.
